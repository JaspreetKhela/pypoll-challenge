# PyPoll Challenge

## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of this election analysis audit was to count the number of voters (in total and per county) who voted in the election and the number of votes that candidates recieved so that the winner of the election could be determined. This Python script allows raw election data to be quickly parsed to determine these aspects of an election.
